# CarparkApp

A simple Android application that searches for carparks near an input location, and provides directions from a selected carpark
to the input location.

The idea behind is app is to solve the problem of visiting unfamiliar places or places where parking is a pain (eg. in the city),
where drivers are often unsure of where to dump their car. This app searches for the nearby carparks, provides directions on how
to get that carpark, and directions from the carpark to the intended place of visit.
